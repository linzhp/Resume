\section{Experience}
\subsection{Software Development}
\cventry{2017--present}{Software Engineer}{Uber Technologies}{Seattle, WA, USA}{}
{Building the monolithic code repository for all Go code in Uber. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Designing and implementing Bazel build rules for Go
		\item Developing Gazelle and its extensions to generate build rules, and thus becoming the No. 2 contributor to Bazel Gazelle project on Github as of March 2020.
		\item Developing dependency manager based on Go modules
		\item Developing Buck macros and contributing to Facebook Buck project
	\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{2015--2017}{Software Engineer}{Microsoft Corporation}{Redmond, WA, USA}{}
{Building statistical models for the Windows build system, in order to detect abnormal processes, identify factors affecting build time, provide estimates for build time, and propose measures for Windows build performance at different granularity}
\cventry{2010 -- 2015}{Graduate Student Researcher}{University of California}{Santa Cruz, CA, USA}{}{
	Projects:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Worked on \textsc{CHEKOFV} project, funded by DARPA's CSFV program, that tried to build games for crowd sourced formal verification. In the first game, \textit{Xylem}, I worked as the main backend (Node.js and Express) developer and one of key developers of the game client (ActionScript 3). In the second game, \textit{Binary Fission}, I worked as the main backend (Python and Flask) developer.
		\item Worked on a NASA funded project \textit{Understanding the Design Space of Mixed Initiative Robot Design Tools}, developed the prototype, \textit{Botprint} in JavaScript. It used Raphael.js to sketch the robot chassis in 2D, and Three.js to render it in 3D.
		\item Worked on a NSF funded project on bug prediction. Extended the open source project \textit{CVSAnalY} to identify commits that introduce buggy code chunks.
	\end{itemize}
}
\cventry{2014}{SDET Intern}{Microsoft Corporation}{Redmond, WA, USA}{}
{Built machine learning models to predict Windows build time and analyzed factors are most likely to cause build breaks}
\cventry{2013}{Software Engineering Intern}{Google Inc.}{Mountain View, CA, USA}{}
{Developed a JavaScript fuzzer that generates random JavaScript to test Closure Compiler.}
